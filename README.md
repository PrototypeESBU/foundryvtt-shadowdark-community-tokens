# Shadowdark Community Tokens
For use with foundry VTT

This is a collection of tokens based on both AI Art and Real Art to use in Virtual Table Top Games.
While this module is specifically designed for Foundry, the actual tokens and artwork can be used in any VTT game. This is a community efort, and as a result there are many contributors and artists have given their consent to use their property, but at any point in time may revoke it and changes will be made as soon as possible.
